Class 2 - Reality We help define what your reality is made up of and why it is so important as to how you interperet life, we also look at how we use negative control to try and change another person's reality, or let them control our reality. Class 3 - Reality Part 2 Feelings We dig into some more important items about reality, specifically. The Drama Triangle, what it is and how to identify if you are in it. The positive and negative sides of our feelings, and how to identify them, and control them. Class 4 - Boundaries Now that we have started to understand how do we protect that, and protect us from forcing that reality onto others? Boundaries are how, they are the containers of our Reality. Not only do they protect us, but they also protect others from us. Class 5 - Self Care Knowing our needs and wants is a pivotal step in creating connection in relationships, as well as balancing that share of their needs and wants along with your own needs and wants. This in conjunction with bringing your own reality and boundaries in moderation into the relationship creates the connection that is fulfilling for both people involved. Class 6 - Moderation As you grow you start to become aware of areas that are over-the-top or suppressed both of which are not moderate, and then as you bring those areas into healing you will start to notice they get pulled back to a more balanced moderate response. Moderation is the balancing piece that ties very closely to your reality and boundaries, all three combined to give you a sense of your own empowerment and value. Class 7 - Self Esteem Value is what we all strive for, and in the weeks lesson we dig into the different types and how we can work to keep it within ourselves, as well as becoming aware of when we have placed it outside of ourselves and therefor are trying to control others. Class 8 - Grace, Truth & Time Now that we have the tools we to work through re-parenting ourselves.

Use your memory to tell the difference. People, who, over time, have a loving track record. See if their walk matches their talk. People who can be observed from some emotional distance. Take small risks in vulnerability before taking bigger risks. People with the ability to accept imperfections in others. This refers to the difference between those who love the outside and those who love the inner self. People who are no stranger to pain, yet are recovering. Those who have suffered spiritually and emotionally can identify with developmental injuries. People who are aware of their own deficits. Those who know their unfinished parts are more likely to be safe with the unfinished parts of others. People who have truth without condemnation. It's easier to entrust our weaknesses to those who love us, and who will \"(speak) the truth in love\" (Ephesians 4:15). People who have grace without license. Attaching to others who see God's grace as leading to greater responsibility helps us to experience grace appropriately. People who bear good fruit in your life. Ask yourself if your relationship with this person has made you more or less loving and responsible. Break the dysfunctional family rules of \"don't talk, don't trust, don't feel\", by actively seeking a confessional relationship. Generally, a \"safe\" person will give you permission (when you can't give it to yourself) to be human. Safety is measured by our ability to be who we really are with a particular person or in a certain setting - a place where we can talk about our fears, our feelings, our experiences without being judged or shamed. There are safe people and safe places. To find them you must take a risk. Share; check; share. God created us not to be dependent or independent, but interdependent . Don't expect perfection from yourself or from others, but look for a realistic \"good enough.\" Whatever is unconfessed is beyond the reach of healing.

Anytime we refuse to take responsibility for ourselves, we are opting to play victim. This leaves us feeling at the mercy of, done in by, and unfaired against no matter what our situation might be. Victimhood consists of three positions outlined by Stephen Karpman, a teacher of Transactional Analysis, on what he called the \"Drama Triangle.\u201d Having learned of it some thirty years ago, it has been one of the most important tools in my personal, as well as professional life. As my understanding of the Drama Triangle has expanded, so has my appreciation for this simple, but powerfully accurate instrument. I call it the \"shame machine\" because through it we unconsciously re-enact our vicious cycles, thereby creating shame. Every dysfunctional interaction takes place on the Drama Triangle. Until we make these dynamics conscious, we cannot transform them. Unless we transform them, we cannot move forward on our journey towards reclaiming our spiritual heritage. Karpman named the three roles on the Drama Triangle: persecutor, rescuer and victim and placed them on an upside down triangle representing the three faces of victim. Even though only one is called \u201cvictim\u201d, all three originate out of and end up back there . Therefore they are all stopping places on the road to victimhood. We each have a most familiar, or what I call starting gate position. [IMAGE] We first learn our primary position from within our family. Although we each have a role we most identify with, we will also rotate through the other positions, going completely around the triangle, sometimes in a matter of minutes, or even seconds, many times every day. It's difficult to see ourselves or others as victims when we are in a care-taking (rescuer) or blaming (persecutor) role. Nonetheless these two, rescuer and persecutor, are the two opposite extremes of victim. This is simply because all roles eventually lead back to victim. It's inevitable. You might notice that both the persecutor and rescuer are on the upper end of the triangle. Whenever we assume either of those stances, we come across as one-up. From either position we are relating as though we are better, stronger, smarter, or more together than the victim. Sooner or later the victim, who is in a one-down position, develops a metaphorical \"crick in the neck\" from looking up. Feeling \u201clooked down upon,\u201d resentment builds and some form of retaliation inevitably follows. At that point, the victim moves into a persecutor role. Reminiscent of a notso-musical game of musical chairs, all players sooner or later rotate positions. Here's an example. Dad comes home from work to find Mom coming down hard on Junior with \"Clean up your room or else\" threats. He immediately comes to the rescue, \"Mom,\" he might say, \"give the boy a break.\u201d Any one of several possibilities might occur next. Perhaps Mom, feeling victimized by Dad, turns on him, automatically moving him into a victim position. They might do a few quick trips around the triangle with Junior on the sidelines. Or maybe Junior joins dad in a persecutory \"Let's gang up on mom\" approach, and they could play it from that angle. Or Junior could turn-coat on dad, rescuing mom with \"Mind your own business, Dad . . . I don't need your help!\" So it goes, with endless variations perhaps, but nonetheless, round and round the triangle. For many families, it's the only way they know how to communicate. Everyone has a starting gate position on the Drama Triangle. This is not only the place we most often get hooked, but also the role through which we actually define ourselves; a strong part of our identity. Each starting gate position has its own particular way of seeing and reacting to the world. Each primary position originates out of a particular life theme and moves around the triangle in its own distinct way. For instance, although we all eventually end up in the victim position on the triangle, the starting gate position of Rescuer (from here forward starting gate positions will be capitalized to differentiate them from the movement through a particular role) moves through victim and persecutor in a very different way than do either a primary Persecutor or Victim. The Rescuer moves into victim wearing the cloak of martyrdom (\"After all I've done for you...\"), whereas a Persecutor claims victim as a way to justify vengeance (\u201cIf it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had to\u2026\"). Whereas a Rescuer may persecute by withdrawing their care-taking, a Persecutor's rescuing is liable to be almost as painful as when they are in attack mode. And a starting gate Victim is perpetually pitiful and incapable. They even rescue from a one-down position (\"You're the only one who can help me, because you're so talented, or smart, or whatever!\") Our primary positions are generally set up in childhood. For instance, if a parent is overly protective, doing everything for a child, then that child may grow up to feel incapable of taking care of themselves. This sets them up for a life time role of Victim. Or the opposite; they might come to feel angry and vindictive if others don't take care of them, thereby adopting a primary Persecutor stance. There are many variations, and each case needs to be individually considered. We not only act out these triangular distortions in our everyday relations with others, but also internally. We move around the triangle as rapidly inside our minds as we do out in the world. We trap ourselves with dishonest and dysfunctional internal dialogue. For example, we may come down hard on ourselves for not completing a project. Perhaps we lambaste ourselves as being lazy, inadequate or defective, causing us to spiral into feelings of anger and selfworthlessness. Inwardly, we cow to this persecutory voice, fearing it may be right. Can you see the persecutor/victim exchange happening here? As soon as we begin to blame or insult, a victim is created. And in this case, we're it! This could go on for minutes, hours or days, but sooner or later, there will be a voice in us that comes to the rescue. Because we're feeling lousy and need relief, we start to make excuses, \"Well, I would have finished that project if it hadn't been for...\u201d we might say. Now we have moved into rescuer. Sometimes we rescue ourselves (and others) by denying what we know: \"If I look the other way and pretend not to notice, it will go away\" sort of tactic. These inner dramas perpetuate a vicious cycle of shame spirals and self-loathing. Similar to the way a generator produces electricity, the Drama Triangle generates shame. Whether through internal interaction or external communication, moving around the triangle keeps the self-disparaging messages going. The Drama Triangle becomes our own personal shame machine. The good news is that we can do something about it. All we have to do is learn to turn off the shame machine in order to get off the triangle. It's a simple, although not easy, remedy. Before we can get off the triangle we have to recognize and be willing to let go of the drama produced therein. We must first become intimately acquainted with the costs and trade-offs of each stopping place on the path of victimhood. This allows us not only to recognize the various roles, but to realistically evaluate the consequences of being there as well. Identifying the language and moves of each role further helps us to apprehend when we are being invited by others to join them on the triangle. With this awareness, we can choose whether or not we want to dance to the shame-generating tune of victim. With that end in mind, let's examine each role carefully. Resuer The Rescuer role is the shadow mother principle. It's the typically co-dependent response we think of as \"smothering.\" It's a twisted version of the feminine aspect that desires to nurture and protect. The Rescuer is the enabler, protector, mediator; the one who wants to \"fix\" the problem. Of course, before a Rescuer can remedy a problem there needs to be one. Part of the problem of rescuing is that it comes from an unconscious need to feel important or establish oneself as the savior. Taking care of others is the only way a Rescuer knows how to connect or feel worthwhile. Rescuers usually grow up in families where they were put down or shamed for having needs. They therefore learn to deny those needs, turning instead to taking care of others. This makes having someone who needs them essential. Very often, Rescuers operate out of the hope that if they just take care of others well enough they will get their turn, too. Unfortunately this rarely happens. Often the resulting disappointment sends them spiraling into depression. Martyrdom and depression earmark the victim phase of a Rescuer's dance around the triangle. This is when you hear them say things such as, \"This is what I get, after all I've done for you\" or \"No matter how much I do, it's never enough\" or \"If you loved me, you would be more supportive.\" A Rescuer's greatest fear is that there will be nobody there for them. They compensate for that anxiety by making it a point to be there for others, thus encouraging dependency. Making themselves indispensable becomes a primary way of avoiding abandonment and it provides the validation they long for as well. Rescuers are oblivious to the crippling dependency they foster when they enable or take care of those they are fixated on. Through these tactics, they send disabling messages. Everyone involved becomes convinced that the Victim is incapable, inadequate or defective, thus reinforcing the need for constant rescue. It becomes the job of the Rescuer to keep the other propped up, \"for their own good,\" of course. Having a Victim to care-take is essential in order for the Rescuer to maintain an illusion of being one-up and needless. This means then, that there will always be at least one person in every core Rescuer\u2019s life who is sick, fragile, inept and in need of their care. Beatrice grew up seeing her mother as helpless and impotent. From an early age, she felt a huge responsibility to take care of her frail parent. Her own well being depended on it, or else how was she, a small child, going to make it? As the years went by, however, she could scarcely contain the inner rage she felt towards her mother for being so needy and weak. As a starting gate Rescuer, she would do all she could to bolster her mother, only to come away again and again, feeling defeated (victim) because nothing she tried worked. Inevitably the resentment would take over leading her to resort to treating her mother with scorn (persecutor). This became her primary interactive pattern, not only with her mother, but in all of her relationships. By the time I met her she was emotionally, physically and spiritually exhausted from having spent her life taking care of one sick and dependent person after another. Persecutor Like the other roles, the Persecutor is shame based. It's the sort of shame-drenched anger that results from growing up overloaded with scorn. Persecutors have long ago repressed their convictions of worthlessness, covering them instead with indignant wrath and an attitude of uncaring. In the same way that the Rescuer is the shadow mother principle, this role is the shadow father principle. The beneficent father's job is to protect and provide for his family. The Persecutor role is a perversion of that energy, instead attempting to \"reform\" through force. This role is taken on by someone who has learned to meet their needs through authoritarian, controlling and often punishing methods. The Persecutor overcomes feelings of shame by overpowering others. Domination becomes their most prevalent style of interaction. This means they must always be right! Techniques include preaching, blaming, lecturing, interrogating, and attack. They believe in getting even, very often through passive aggressive acts. Just like the Rescuer needs someone to fix, the Persecutor needs someone to blame. Persecutors deny their weaknesses in the same way Rescuers deny their needs. Their greatest fear is powerlessness. Denying their own infirmities, they are in constant need of someone on whom they can project their own unclaimed inadequacies. Both Rescuers and Persecutors therefore need a Victim in order to sustain their place on the triangle. Persecutors also tend to compensate for inner feelings of worthlessness by putting on grandiose airs. Grandiosity inevitably comes from shame. It provides compensation and a cover-up for a deep internal inferiority. Superiority is about swinging hard to the other side of \"less than\" in order to come across as \"better than.\" I recall a client, a doctor who exemplified Persecutor mentality. He truly thought hurting others was justified as a compensation for his own pain. He told me once in session about running into a patient of his on the golf course, who \"had the nerve\" to ask for on-the-spot treatment. \"Can you believe he asked me to treat his injury on my one day off?\" he railed. \"That does seem pretty bold,\" I replied, \"how did you handle it?\" \"Oh, I took him to my office, alright\u2026 and he got a steroid shot, too,\" the doctor chuckled, \"but I bet he'll never ask me to do that again.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked, not quite following. \"Because that shot was one he'll never forget!\" To the doctor, his action was totally justifiable. His patient had infringed on him and thereby deserved whatever pain he got. This is a prime example of Persecutor thinking. It never occurred to my client that he could have said no; that he did not have to feel victimized by, or have to rescue this patient. In his mind he had been treated unjustly and therefore had the right, even the obligation, to get even. It is most difficult for someone in this stance to take responsibility for the way they hurt others. In their mind, others deserve what they get. These warring individuals tend to see themselves as having to fight the world for survival. Their battle cry might well be, \"I've been treated unfairly and somebody's going to pay!\" Theirs is a constant struggle to regain that which they perceive has been taken from them. Victim The Victim is a life role most often taken on by someone who was raised by a dedicated Rescuer. It is the shadow of the precious child within; that part in each of us that is innocent, vulnerable and needy. This child-self does need support and \"care taken\" on occasion, but when an individual becomes convinced that they can never take care of themselves they can easily take on a primary Victim stance. Buying into the idea that they are intrinsically defective, Victims adopt an attitude of \"I can't make it.\u201d This becomes their greatest fear, forcing them to be ever on the lookout for someone more capable to carry them. Victims deny both their problem solving abilities and their potential for self-generated power. Instead they tend to see themselves as too fragile to handle life. Feeling done in by, at the mercy of, mistreated, intrinsically bad and wrong, they see themselves as the \"unfixable problem.\" This doesn't stop them, however from feeling highly resentful for their dependency. Victims eventually get fed up with being in the one-down position and find ways to get even. A move to persecutor usually means sabotaging the efforts made to rescue them, as well as other passiveaggressive behaviors. They are very apt players of the game called \"Yes, but\u2026\" Any time a helpful suggestion is offered, a Victim response might be, \"Yes, but that won't work because\u2026\u201d They may also resort to the persecutor role as a way to blame or manipulate others into taking care of them. The Victim eats a daily menu of shame. Convinced of their intrinsic incompetence, they live in a perpetual shame spiral, often leading to self-abuse. Perpetual Victims walk around much like the Charlie Brown character, Pigpen, in his whirlwind of dust, except Victims are surrounded in a shame vortex of their own making. This cloud of shame becomes their total identity. Linda was the second-born in her family. Almost from birth, she had problems. Linda was a child who was forever in trouble of one sort or another. She struggled academically, was perpetually disruptive and often sick. It came as no surprise to anyone when she got into drugs as a teenager. Her mother, Stella, was a die-hard Rescuer. Thinking she was being helpful, Stella bailed Linda out every time she got in trouble. By alleviating the natural consequences, Stella's earnest enabling deprived Linda of the opportunity to learn from her poor choices. As a result, Linda came to see herself as incapable, becoming dependent on someone beside herself to fix things for her. Her mother's well-intentioned rescuing sent a crippling message, which promoted a life long Victim stance, keeping Linda needy and ever vigilant for a potential Rescuer. Projection and Shadow of Victimhood As individuals grow in awareness and change, they often change their starting gate positions. Becoming aware of a primary position, they may commit to change but often merely switch roles instead. Although they may be operating from a different place, they are nonetheless still on the triangle. This happens frequently and may even be an essential part of learning the full impact of living on the triangle. Placing the three positions on a straight line with Victim in the middle is a way of demonstrating that Persecutor and Rescuer are simply the two extremes of victim-hood. Persecutor ------ VICTIM ------- Rescuer All three roles are merely the perverted expression of positive powers we each hold in potential, but deny. The primary face we take on determines which of these powers is being denied. The Rescuer part of us contains the gift for mediation and problem solving. It might be deemed a feminine aspect. The Persecutor, on the other hand, is the part of us that knows about the use of power and assertiveness. It might be considered a masculine attribute. When these essential qualities are not fully acknowledged and claimed, they get repressed into the unconscious, where they then come out in the perverted expression we see on the Drama Triangle. In other words, because these aspects are denied, they get acted out in unconscious and irresponsible ways. When we suppress both our problem solving ability and our power for assertive action, we take on a posture of Victim. When we see ourselves as primary mediators and caretakers, but deny our need to stand ground for ourselves by setting appropriate boundaries, we occupy the Rescuer position. Persecutors on the other hand, have hidden their caring, nurturing qualities, and therefore tend to problem solve through anger, abuse and control. In essence, the victim's dance is a constant, unconscious surfacing of unclaimed aspects of personality that produces perpetual drama in our lives. We live in a Victim-based society. In the United States, we like to think of ourselves as Rescuers. For many years we identified Russia as the Persecutor with third-world countries being the identified underdog, or Victim. Years ago, USSR's President Gorbachev was said to tell President Bush, \"I'm about to do the worst thing imaginable, I'm going to take away your enemy!\" Here was a man who innately understood our country's need to have a scapegoat, providing us the chance to say, \"It's those bad communists again.\u201d Otherwise, we as Americans might be forced to take responsibility for our own perpetrator tendencies. Of course, Russia does perpetrate, as witnessed by the doings of their KGB, but haven't our own CIA shown similar tendencies? Our very history is built on persecution. Within a few years of arriving in America, our forefathers began to systematically oppress and subjugate the Native Americans who had lived here for centuries. It seems a wearisome task for this country to get willing to be accountable for the ways we have persecuted. Instead, we seem bound and determined to hold onto the idea of being the world's \"good guy.\u201d It is always difficult for Persecutors to perceive themselves as such, however. It is much easier to justify persecutor behavior than it is to own the oppressor role. The cycle goes like this: \"I was just trying to help (rescuer), and they turned on me (victim), so I had to defend myself\" (persecutor). Persecution is almost always justified as a necessary defense. It is the role most often denied. After all, who wants to admit that they ill-use people? The Rescuer, on the other hand, has no trouble identifying with the helper role. They are generally proud of their position as caretakers and fixers. They are socially acclaimed and rewarded for \"selfless acts\" of rescuing. They believe in the goodness of being caretakers, seeing themselves as ever helpful. What they deny is the ill-begotten consequences of their enabling/disabling acts. But what these \"do-gooders\" have most difficulty seeing is how they, themselves end up as victims. It's very hard for a Rescuer to hear themselves referred to as victims even when they get caught red-handed complaining about how mistreated they are! Triangular Pain Living life on the Drama Triangle creates misery in many ways. The primary commonality is that none of the players are willing (or even know how) to take responsibility for themselves. The price paid is tremendous for all three roles lead to emotional, mental and even physical pain. Evading responsibility and/or attempting to protect oneself or others doesn't work, and yet it is the primary goal of those caught up on the triangle. The simple truth is that the greatest pain is the anguish created in trying to avoid it. When we try to shield others from the truth, we discount their abilities. This is disabling and leads to negative reactions all around. Everyone involved ends up hurt and angry. No one wins. As long as we chase ourselves and others around the Triangle, we relegate ourselves to living in robot-like, knee-jerk reaction. Rather than living vibrant lives of spontaneity and choice, we settle for a sort of pseudo-aliveness. Experiencing a full life requires the ability to interact as free agents. This is impossible as long as we are involved in the Drama Triangle. Denied Feelings Frequently we find entry onto the triangle through the port of denied feelings. Whenever we deny our own or another's feelings we inevitably end up playing a role on the triangle. We rescue others anytime we attempt to keep them from feeling bad. (\"I can't tell Jim what I think because it'll hurt his feelings.\") So we keep our opinions, feelings and thoughts secret which inevitably creates distance. Parents who grew up without permission to acknowledge or express feelings often deny their children the same right. Repressed, these denied emotions become secret shame pockets, alienating us from others and sentencing us to life on the triangle. Feelings may be intangible, but they are nonetheless real. Anytime we deny access to our feeling experience we set ourselves up for a victim perspective. We cannot take responsibility for feelings we have not allowed ourselves to acknowledge, therefore we end up on the triangle. Shame and Core Beliefs Triangular interaction is the primary way that shame is generated. Each role moves around the triangle in its own distinct way. This is because each starting gate position has a set of core beliefs that tends to set them up for that particular role. These unconscious attitudes are what create feelings of worthlessness, inadequacy and or defectiveness. The triangle is the way we reinforce and perpetuate those shame-producing beliefs. Rescuers, for instance, believe that their needs are unimportant and irrelevant and therefore do not deserve to be met. The only way they can legitimately connect with others (in order to meet the need to belong and feel important) is by taking care of someone else. Rescuers guilt themselves when they aren't care-taking others. Their primary myth is \"If I take care of others well enough... long enough\u2026 then I will get my turn.\" Unfortunately, on the triangle, Rescuers are taking care of life time Victims who have no idea of how to be there for others. This reinforces the caretaker's core belief (\"my needs don't count\"), which in turn produces more shame around needing. Guilt and shame are powerful driving forces for the perpetuation of the Triangle. Guilt is often used by Victims in an effort to hook their Rescuer into taking care of them. (\"If you don't do it, who will?\u201d) The Victim\u2019s shame-producing belief of not being able to make it on their own leaves them feeling powerless and needy. Persecutors, believing the world is dangerous, use shame as a primary tool for keeping others in their place. Their primary goal is to feel safe by putting others down. \"Get them before they get me!\" is their primary agenda. What better way of accomplishing that, then to judge, moralize or denigrate their victims? Dishonesty Of course, it follows suit that once we learn to deny our feeling reality, honesty becomes impossible. Telling our truth first requires knowing it. When we react out of denied feelings and unconscious programming, we cannot possibly know our personal truth. This means there will be hidden agendas and dishonesty. This is another primary trait of all players on the triangle. Only by knowing our truth, can we begin to speak from a place of personal honesty. Then, getting off the triangle becomes possible. Failed Intimacy Although we all long for a sense of connection with others, many people are secretly terrified of intimacy. Letting someone really know us can be a frightening experience. Intimacy requires vulnerability and honest disclosure. Believing that we are at heart unlovable, defective or \"less than\" makes it difficult to reveal ourselves. We want to feel unconditionally accepted, but when we haven't accepted ourselves, it's impossible to believe that anyone else could embrace us. Thinking we need to hide our unworthiness makes keeping a distance imperative. As long as we maintain hidden agendas and deny our truth, intimacy is impossible. Victimhood is designed to insure alienation, not only from others, but also from ourselves. Getting Off the Triangle In order to get off the Triangle, we must first decide to take responsibility for ourselves. We then begin to allow ourselves to acknowledge and express our true feelings, even when doing so is uncomfortable. As we explore our core beliefs and starting gate positions, we become better able to recognize when someone is attempting to hook us, and refuse to allow it. Learning how to sit with guilty feelings without acting on them is a big part of resisting the Victim game . Feeling guilt does not necessarily imply that we are out of integrity with ourselves. Guilt is a learned response. Sometimes guilt indicates that we've broken a dysfunctional family rule. Growth-prohibitive beliefs about ourselves and the world, instilled early on, become rigid rules that need to be violated. Family dictums such as \"Don't talk about it\", \"Don't share feelings\", or \"It's selfish to take care of yourself\", must be overcome if we are to grow. We can expect, and even celebrate the guilt when we defy these deeply entrenched unwritten laws. Getting honest with ourselves and others is a primary way to get off the triangle. Telling our truth is a key way of taking responsibility. We then must be willing to take necessary action for whatever that truth reveals. In order for a Rescuer to get honest, for instance, they have to confess their investment in keeping others dependent. This means acknowledging that being a Rescuer fills their need for self worth. In this way, Rescuers learn to recognize and address their own needs. It can feel very threatening for someone stuck in Persecutor consciousness to get bare-bones honest with themselves. To them, to do so feels like blaming themselves, which only intensifies their internal condemnation. Persecutors need to have a situation or person they can blame so they can stay angry. Anger energizes them by acting like fuel in the psyche that keeps them going. It may be the only way they have of dealing with chronic depression. Persecutors need a jolt of rage the same way some people need a shot of caffeine. It jump-starts their day. Just as with the other roles, self-accountability is the only way off the victim grid for the Persecutor. There has to be some kind of breakthrough for them to get willing to own their part. Unfortunately, because of their great reluctance to do so, it may have to come in the form of a crisis. Ironically, the doorway off the triangle for all players is through the persecutor position. This is because when we decide to get off the triangle, we are often seen as persecutors by those still on it . Once we decide to take self-responsibility and tell our truth, those still aboard are likely to accuse us of victimizing them. \"How dare you refuse to take care of me!\" a Victim might cry. Or \"What do you mean you don't need my help?\" says a primary enabler when a victim decides to become accountable. In other words, to escape the victim grid, we must be willing to be perceived as the \"bad guy.\u201d This doesn't make it so, but we must be willing to sit with the discomfort of being perceived as such. When you are ready to be accountable, you begin by sorting through your real motives and feelings regarding your present situation. You become willing to experience your own uncomfortable feelings and to allow others theirs without rescue. If your loved ones and associates are also willing to participate in this process of self-realization, it speeds the halt of triangular interaction. If you're ready to get off, but they aren't, then you may have to draw some hard-fast boundaries, or even walk away. Again, this puts you at risk of being perceived as a persecutor. Since starting gate Victims are the identified problem in their family, it's natural for them to seek outside professional help. Often, however they are unconsciously looking for another Rescuer (which abound among helping professionals, by the way). Those in primary Victim roles must challenge the ingrained belief that they can't do for themselves. If they are to get off the triangle, they have to initiate self-care, rather than look outside themselves for a savior. Instead of seeing themselves as totally powerless, they must begin to acknowledge their problem solving as well as their leadership capabilities. In conclusion, we must first become conscious of how it is we play out the Drama Triangle. For where ever there is dysfunction, the Drama Triangle is found. Making ourselves aware of our starting gate positions is the first step to moving out of destructive patterns. As we begin the process of liberating ourselves from our stuckness through self-responsibility and truth telling, we transform our lives. In other words, we actualize our Higher Selves, thus realizing the blueprint of possibility that lies dormant within each of us.","title":"The Three Faces of Victim"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#the-three-faces-of-victim","text":"","title":"The Three Faces of Victim"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#by-lynne-forrest-edited-for-clarity-by-imago-dei-ministries","text":"Most of us unconsciously react to life from a position of victimhood. Anytime we refuse to take responsibility for ourselves, we are opting to play victim. This leaves us feeling at the mercy of, done in by, and unfaired against no matter what our situation might be. Victimhood consists of three positions outlined by Stephen Karpman, a teacher of Transactional Analysis, on what he called the \"Drama Triangle.\u201d Having learned of it some thirty years ago, it has been one of the most important tools in my personal, as well as professional life. As my understanding of the Drama Triangle has expanded, so has my appreciation for this simple, but powerfully accurate instrument. I call it the \"shame machine\" because through it we unconsciously re-enact our vicious cycles, thereby creating shame. Every dysfunctional interaction takes place on the Drama Triangle. Until we make these dynamics conscious, we cannot transform them. Unless we transform them, we cannot move forward on our journey towards reclaiming our spiritual heritage. Karpman named the three roles on the Drama Triangle: persecutor, rescuer and victim and placed them on an upside down triangle representing the three faces of victim. Even though only one is called \u201cvictim\u201d, all three originate out of and end up back there . Therefore they are all stopping places on the road to victimhood. We each have a most familiar, or what I call starting gate position. [IMAGE] We first learn our primary position from within our family. Although we each have a role we most identify with, we will also rotate through the other positions, going completely around the triangle, sometimes in a matter of minutes, or even seconds, many times every day. It's difficult to see ourselves or others as victims when we are in a care-taking (rescuer) or blaming (persecutor) role. Nonetheless these two, rescuer and persecutor, are the two opposite extremes of victim. This is simply because all roles eventually lead back to victim. It's inevitable. You might notice that both the persecutor and rescuer are on the upper end of the triangle. Whenever we assume either of those stances, we come across as one-up. From either position we are relating as though we are better, stronger, smarter, or more together than the victim. Sooner or later the victim, who is in a one-down position, develops a metaphorical \"crick in the neck\" from looking up. Feeling \u201clooked down upon,\u201d resentment builds and some form of retaliation inevitably follows. At that point, the victim moves into a persecutor role. Reminiscent of a notso-musical game of musical chairs, all players sooner or later rotate positions. Here's an example. Dad comes home from work to find Mom coming down hard on Junior with \"Clean up your room or else\" threats. He immediately comes to the rescue, \"Mom,\" he might say, \"give the boy a break.\u201d Any one of several possibilities might occur next. Perhaps Mom, feeling victimized by Dad, turns on him, automatically moving him into a victim position. They might do a few quick trips around the triangle with Junior on the sidelines. Or maybe Junior joins dad in a persecutory \"Let's gang up on mom\" approach, and they could play it from that angle. Or Junior could turn-coat on dad, rescuing mom with \"Mind your own business, Dad . . . I don't need your help!\" So it goes, with endless variations perhaps, but nonetheless, round and round the triangle. For many families, it's the only way they know how to communicate. Everyone has a starting gate position on the Drama Triangle. This is not only the place we most often get hooked, but also the role through which we actually define ourselves; a strong part of our identity. Each starting gate position has its own particular way of seeing and reacting to the world. Each primary position originates out of a particular life theme and moves around the triangle in its own distinct way. For instance, although we all eventually end up in the victim position on the triangle, the starting gate position of Rescuer (from here forward starting gate positions will be capitalized to differentiate them from the movement through a particular role) moves through victim and persecutor in a very different way than do either a primary Persecutor or Victim. The Rescuer moves into victim wearing the cloak of martyrdom (\"After all I've done for you...\"), whereas a Persecutor claims victim as a way to justify vengeance (\u201cIf it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had to\u2026\"). Whereas a Rescuer may persecute by withdrawing their care-taking, a Persecutor's rescuing is liable to be almost as painful as when they are in attack mode. And a starting gate Victim is perpetually pitiful and incapable. They even rescue from a one-down position (\"You're the only one who can help me, because you're so talented, or smart, or whatever!\") Our primary positions are generally set up in childhood. For instance, if a parent is overly protective, doing everything for a child, then that child may grow up to feel incapable of taking care of themselves. This sets them up for a life time role of Victim. Or the opposite; they might come to feel angry and vindictive if others don't take care of them, thereby adopting a primary Persecutor stance. There are many variations, and each case needs to be individually considered. We not only act out these triangular distortions in our everyday relations with others, but also internally. We move around the triangle as rapidly inside our minds as we do out in the world. We trap ourselves with dishonest and dysfunctional internal dialogue. For example, we may come down hard on ourselves for not completing a project. Perhaps we lambaste ourselves as being lazy, inadequate or defective, causing us to spiral into feelings of anger and selfworthlessness. Inwardly, we cow to this persecutory voice, fearing it may be right. Can you see the persecutor/victim exchange happening here? As soon as we begin to blame or insult, a victim is created. And in this case, we're it! This could go on for minutes, hours or days, but sooner or later, there will be a voice in us that comes to the rescue. Because we're feeling lousy and need relief, we start to make excuses, \"Well, I would have finished that project if it hadn't been for...\u201d we might say. Now we have moved into rescuer. Sometimes we rescue ourselves (and others) by denying what we know: \"If I look the other way and pretend not to notice, it will go away\" sort of tactic. These inner dramas perpetuate a vicious cycle of shame spirals and self-loathing. Similar to the way a generator produces electricity, the Drama Triangle generates shame. Whether through internal interaction or external communication, moving around the triangle keeps the self-disparaging messages going. The Drama Triangle becomes our own personal shame machine. The good news is that we can do something about it. All we have to do is learn to turn off the shame machine in order to get off the triangle. It's a simple, although not easy, remedy. Before we can get off the triangle we have to recognize and be willing to let go of the drama produced therein. We must first become intimately acquainted with the costs and trade-offs of each stopping place on the path of victimhood. This allows us not only to recognize the various roles, but to realistically evaluate the consequences of being there as well. Identifying the language and moves of each role further helps us to apprehend when we are being invited by others to join them on the triangle. With this awareness, we can choose whether or not we want to dance to the shame-generating tune of victim. With that end in mind, let's examine each role carefully.","title":"By Lynne Forrest (edited for clarity by Imago Dei Ministries)"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#resuer","text":"The Rescuer role is the shadow mother principle. It's the typically co-dependent response we think of as \"smothering.\" It's a twisted version of the feminine aspect that desires to nurture and protect. The Rescuer is the enabler, protector, mediator; the one who wants to \"fix\" the problem. Of course, before a Rescuer can remedy a problem there needs to be one. Part of the problem of rescuing is that it comes from an unconscious need to feel important or establish oneself as the savior. Taking care of others is the only way a Rescuer knows how to connect or feel worthwhile. Rescuers usually grow up in families where they were put down or shamed for having needs. They therefore learn to deny those needs, turning instead to taking care of others. This makes having someone who needs them essential. Very often, Rescuers operate out of the hope that if they just take care of others well enough they will get their turn, too. Unfortunately this rarely happens. Often the resulting disappointment sends them spiraling into depression. Martyrdom and depression earmark the victim phase of a Rescuer's dance around the triangle. This is when you hear them say things such as, \"This is what I get, after all I've done for you\" or \"No matter how much I do, it's never enough\" or \"If you loved me, you would be more supportive.\" A Rescuer's greatest fear is that there will be nobody there for them. They compensate for that anxiety by making it a point to be there for others, thus encouraging dependency. Making themselves indispensable becomes a primary way of avoiding abandonment and it provides the validation they long for as well. Rescuers are oblivious to the crippling dependency they foster when they enable or take care of those they are fixated on. Through these tactics, they send disabling messages. Everyone involved becomes convinced that the Victim is incapable, inadequate or defective, thus reinforcing the need for constant rescue. It becomes the job of the Rescuer to keep the other propped up, \"for their own good,\" of course. Having a Victim to care-take is essential in order for the Rescuer to maintain an illusion of being one-up and needless. This means then, that there will always be at least one person in every core Rescuer\u2019s life who is sick, fragile, inept and in need of their care. Beatrice grew up seeing her mother as helpless and impotent. From an early age, she felt a huge responsibility to take care of her frail parent. Her own well being depended on it, or else how was she, a small child, going to make it? As the years went by, however, she could scarcely contain the inner rage she felt towards her mother for being so needy and weak. As a starting gate Rescuer, she would do all she could to bolster her mother, only to come away again and again, feeling defeated (victim) because nothing she tried worked. Inevitably the resentment would take over leading her to resort to treating her mother with scorn (persecutor). This became her primary interactive pattern, not only with her mother, but in all of her relationships. By the time I met her she was emotionally, physically and spiritually exhausted from having spent her life taking care of one sick and dependent person after another.","title":"Resuer"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#persecutor","text":"Like the other roles, the Persecutor is shame based. It's the sort of shame-drenched anger that results from growing up overloaded with scorn. Persecutors have long ago repressed their convictions of worthlessness, covering them instead with indignant wrath and an attitude of uncaring. In the same way that the Rescuer is the shadow mother principle, this role is the shadow father principle. The beneficent father's job is to protect and provide for his family. The Persecutor role is a perversion of that energy, instead attempting to \"reform\" through force. This role is taken on by someone who has learned to meet their needs through authoritarian, controlling and often punishing methods. The Persecutor overcomes feelings of shame by overpowering others. Domination becomes their most prevalent style of interaction. This means they must always be right! Techniques include preaching, blaming, lecturing, interrogating, and attack. They believe in getting even, very often through passive aggressive acts. Just like the Rescuer needs someone to fix, the Persecutor needs someone to blame. Persecutors deny their weaknesses in the same way Rescuers deny their needs. Their greatest fear is powerlessness. Denying their own infirmities, they are in constant need of someone on whom they can project their own unclaimed inadequacies. Both Rescuers and Persecutors therefore need a Victim in order to sustain their place on the triangle. Persecutors also tend to compensate for inner feelings of worthlessness by putting on grandiose airs. Grandiosity inevitably comes from shame. It provides compensation and a cover-up for a deep internal inferiority. Superiority is about swinging hard to the other side of \"less than\" in order to come across as \"better than.\" I recall a client, a doctor who exemplified Persecutor mentality. He truly thought hurting others was justified as a compensation for his own pain. He told me once in session about running into a patient of his on the golf course, who \"had the nerve\" to ask for on-the-spot treatment. \"Can you believe he asked me to treat his injury on my one day off?\" he railed. \"That does seem pretty bold,\" I replied, \"how did you handle it?\" \"Oh, I took him to my office, alright\u2026 and he got a steroid shot, too,\" the doctor chuckled, \"but I bet he'll never ask me to do that again.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked, not quite following. \"Because that shot was one he'll never forget!\" To the doctor, his action was totally justifiable. His patient had infringed on him and thereby deserved whatever pain he got. This is a prime example of Persecutor thinking. It never occurred to my client that he could have said no; that he did not have to feel victimized by, or have to rescue this patient. In his mind he had been treated unjustly and therefore had the right, even the obligation, to get even. It is most difficult for someone in this stance to take responsibility for the way they hurt others. In their mind, others deserve what they get. These warring individuals tend to see themselves as having to fight the world for survival. Their battle cry might well be, \"I've been treated unfairly and somebody's going to pay!\" Theirs is a constant struggle to regain that which they perceive has been taken from them.","title":"Persecutor"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#victim","text":"The Victim is a life role most often taken on by someone who was raised by a dedicated Rescuer. It is the shadow of the precious child within; that part in each of us that is innocent, vulnerable and needy. This child-self does need support and \"care taken\" on occasion, but when an individual becomes convinced that they can never take care of themselves they can easily take on a primary Victim stance. Buying into the idea that they are intrinsically defective, Victims adopt an attitude of \"I can't make it.\u201d This becomes their greatest fear, forcing them to be ever on the lookout for someone more capable to carry them. Victims deny both their problem solving abilities and their potential for self-generated power. Instead they tend to see themselves as too fragile to handle life. Feeling done in by, at the mercy of, mistreated, intrinsically bad and wrong, they see themselves as the \"unfixable problem.\" This doesn't stop them, however from feeling highly resentful for their dependency. Victims eventually get fed up with being in the one-down position and find ways to get even. A move to persecutor usually means sabotaging the efforts made to rescue them, as well as other passiveaggressive behaviors. They are very apt players of the game called \"Yes, but\u2026\" Any time a helpful suggestion is offered, a Victim response might be, \"Yes, but that won't work because\u2026\u201d They may also resort to the persecutor role as a way to blame or manipulate others into taking care of them. The Victim eats a daily menu of shame. Convinced of their intrinsic incompetence, they live in a perpetual shame spiral, often leading to self-abuse. Perpetual Victims walk around much like the Charlie Brown character, Pigpen, in his whirlwind of dust, except Victims are surrounded in a shame vortex of their own making. This cloud of shame becomes their total identity. Linda was the second-born in her family. Almost from birth, she had problems. Linda was a child who was forever in trouble of one sort or another. She struggled academically, was perpetually disruptive and often sick. It came as no surprise to anyone when she got into drugs as a teenager. Her mother, Stella, was a die-hard Rescuer. Thinking she was being helpful, Stella bailed Linda out every time she got in trouble. By alleviating the natural consequences, Stella's earnest enabling deprived Linda of the opportunity to learn from her poor choices. As a result, Linda came to see herself as incapable, becoming dependent on someone beside herself to fix things for her. Her mother's well-intentioned rescuing sent a crippling message, which promoted a life long Victim stance, keeping Linda needy and ever vigilant for a potential Rescuer.","title":"Victim"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#projection-and-shadow-of-victimhood","text":"As individuals grow in awareness and change, they often change their starting gate positions. Becoming aware of a primary position, they may commit to change but often merely switch roles instead. Although they may be operating from a different place, they are nonetheless still on the triangle. This happens frequently and may even be an essential part of learning the full impact of living on the triangle. Placing the three positions on a straight line with Victim in the middle is a way of demonstrating that Persecutor and Rescuer are simply the two extremes of victim-hood. Persecutor ------ VICTIM ------- Rescuer All three roles are merely the perverted expression of positive powers we each hold in potential, but deny. The primary face we take on determines which of these powers is being denied. The Rescuer part of us contains the gift for mediation and problem solving. It might be deemed a feminine aspect. The Persecutor, on the other hand, is the part of us that knows about the use of power and assertiveness. It might be considered a masculine attribute. When these essential qualities are not fully acknowledged and claimed, they get repressed into the unconscious, where they then come out in the perverted expression we see on the Drama Triangle. In other words, because these aspects are denied, they get acted out in unconscious and irresponsible ways. When we suppress both our problem solving ability and our power for assertive action, we take on a posture of Victim. When we see ourselves as primary mediators and caretakers, but deny our need to stand ground for ourselves by setting appropriate boundaries, we occupy the Rescuer position. Persecutors on the other hand, have hidden their caring, nurturing qualities, and therefore tend to problem solve through anger, abuse and control. In essence, the victim's dance is a constant, unconscious surfacing of unclaimed aspects of personality that produces perpetual drama in our lives. We live in a Victim-based society. In the United States, we like to think of ourselves as Rescuers. For many years we identified Russia as the Persecutor with third-world countries being the identified underdog, or Victim. Years ago, USSR's President Gorbachev was said to tell President Bush, \"I'm about to do the worst thing imaginable, I'm going to take away your enemy!\" Here was a man who innately understood our country's need to have a scapegoat, providing us the chance to say, \"It's those bad communists again.\u201d Otherwise, we as Americans might be forced to take responsibility for our own perpetrator tendencies. Of course, Russia does perpetrate, as witnessed by the doings of their KGB, but haven't our own CIA shown similar tendencies? Our very history is built on persecution. Within a few years of arriving in America, our forefathers began to systematically oppress and subjugate the Native Americans who had lived here for centuries. It seems a wearisome task for this country to get willing to be accountable for the ways we have persecuted. Instead, we seem bound and determined to hold onto the idea of being the world's \"good guy.\u201d It is always difficult for Persecutors to perceive themselves as such, however. It is much easier to justify persecutor behavior than it is to own the oppressor role. The cycle goes like this: \"I was just trying to help (rescuer), and they turned on me (victim), so I had to defend myself\" (persecutor). Persecution is almost always justified as a necessary defense. It is the role most often denied. After all, who wants to admit that they ill-use people? The Rescuer, on the other hand, has no trouble identifying with the helper role. They are generally proud of their position as caretakers and fixers. They are socially acclaimed and rewarded for \"selfless acts\" of rescuing. They believe in the goodness of being caretakers, seeing themselves as ever helpful. What they deny is the ill-begotten consequences of their enabling/disabling acts. But what these \"do-gooders\" have most difficulty seeing is how they, themselves end up as victims.

Each role moves around the triangle in its own distinct way. This is because each starting gate position has a set of core beliefs that tends to set them up for that particular role. These unconscious attitudes are what create feelings of worthlessness, inadequacy and or defectiveness. The triangle is the way we reinforce and perpetuate those shame-producing beliefs. Rescuers, for instance, believe that their needs are unimportant and irrelevant and therefore do not deserve to be met. The only way they can legitimately connect with others (in order to meet the need to belong and feel important) is by taking care of someone else. Rescuers guilt themselves when they aren't care-taking others. Their primary myth is \"If I take care of others well enough... long enough\u2026 then I will get my turn.\" Unfortunately, on the triangle, Rescuers are taking care of life time Victims who have no idea of how to be there for others. This reinforces the caretaker's core belief (\"my needs don't count\"), which in turn produces more shame around needing. Guilt and shame are powerful driving forces for the perpetuation of the Triangle. Guilt is often used by Victims in an effort to hook their Rescuer into taking care of them. (\"If you don't do it, who will?\u201d) The Victim\u2019s shame-producing belief of not being able to make it on their own leaves them feeling powerless and needy. Persecutors, believing the world is dangerous, use shame as a primary tool for keeping others in their place. Their primary goal is to feel safe by putting others down. \"Get them before they get me!\" is their primary agenda. What better way of accomplishing that, then to judge, moralize or denigrate their victims?","title":"Shame and Core Beliefs"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#dishonesty","text":"Of course, it follows suit that once we learn to deny our feeling reality, honesty becomes impossible. Telling our truth first requires knowing it. When we react out of denied feelings and unconscious programming, we cannot possibly know our personal truth. This means there will be hidden agendas and dishonesty. This is another primary trait of all players on the triangle. Only by knowing our truth, can we begin to speak from a place of personal honesty. Then, getting off the triangle becomes possible.","title":"Dishonesty"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#failed-intimacy","text":"Although we all long for a sense of connection with others, many people are secretly terrified of intimacy. Letting someone really know us can be a frightening experience. Intimacy requires vulnerability and honest disclosure. Believing that we are at heart unlovable, defective or \"less than\" makes it difficult to reveal ourselves. We want to feel unconditionally accepted, but when we haven't accepted ourselves, it's impossible to believe that anyone else could embrace us. Thinking we need to hide our unworthiness makes keeping a distance imperative. As long as we maintain hidden agendas and deny our truth, intimacy is impossible. Victimhood is designed to insure alienation, not only from others, but also from ourselves.","title":"Failed Intimacy"},{"location":"C2-Reality/TheThreeFacesOfVictim/#getting-off-the-triangle","text":"In order to get off the Triangle, we must first decide to take responsibility for ourselves. We then begin to allow ourselves to acknowledge and express our true feelings, even when doing so is uncomfortable. As we explore our core beliefs and starting gate positions, we become better able to recognize when someone is attempting to hook us, and refuse to allow it. Learning how to sit with guilty feelings without acting on them is a big part of resisting the Victim game . Feeling guilt does not necessarily imply that we are out of integrity with ourselves. Guilt is a learned response. Sometimes guilt indicates that we've broken a dysfunctional family rule. Growth-prohibitive beliefs about ourselves and the world, instilled early on, become rigid rules that need to be violated. Family dictums such as \"Don't talk about it\", \"Don't share feelings\", or \"It's selfish to take care of yourself\", must be overcome if we are to grow. We can expect, and even celebrate the guilt when we defy these deeply entrenched unwritten laws. Getting honest with ourselves and others is a primary way to get off the triangle. Telling our truth is a key way of taking responsibility. We then must be willing to take necessary action for whatever that truth reveals. In order for a Rescuer to get honest, for instance, they have to confess their investment in keeping others dependent. This means acknowledging that being a Rescuer fills their need for self worth. In this way, Rescuers learn to recognize and address their own needs. It can feel very threatening for someone stuck in Persecutor consciousness to get bare-bones honest with themselves. To them, to do so feels like blaming themselves, which only intensifies their internal condemnation. Persecutors need to have a situation or person they can blame so they can stay angry. Anger energizes them by acting like fuel in the psyche that keeps them going. It may be the only way they have of dealing with chronic depression. Persecutors need a jolt of rage the same way some people need a shot of caffeine. It jump-starts their day. Just as with the other roles, self-accountability is the only way off the victim grid for the Persecutor. There has to be some kind of breakthrough for them to get willing to own their part. Unfortunately, because of their great reluctance to do so, it may have to come in the form of a crisis. Ironically, the doorway off the triangle for all players is through the persecutor position. This is because when we decide to get off the triangle, we are often seen as persecutors by those still on it . Once we decide to take self-responsibility and tell our truth, those still aboard are likely to accuse us of victimizing them. \"How dare you refuse to take care of me!\" a Victim might cry. Or \"What do you mean you don't need my help?\" says a primary enabler when a victim decides to become accountable. In other words, to escape the victim grid, we must be willing to be perceived as the \"bad guy.\u201d This doesn't make it so, but we must be willing to sit with the discomfort of being perceived as such. When you are ready to be accountable, you begin by sorting through your real motives and feelings regarding your present situation. You become willing to experience your own uncomfortable feelings and to allow others theirs without rescue. If your loved ones and associates are also willing to participate in this process of self-realization, it speeds the halt of triangular interaction. If you're ready to get off, but they aren't, then you may have to draw some hard-fast boundaries, or even walk away. Again, this puts you at risk of being perceived as a persecutor. Since starting gate Victims are the identified problem in their family, it's natural for them to seek outside professional help. Often, however they are unconsciously looking for another Rescuer (which abound among helping professionals, by the way). Those in primary Victim roles must challenge the ingrained belief that they can't do for themselves. If they are to get off the triangle, they have to initiate self-care, rather than look outside themselves for a savior. Instead of seeing themselves as totally powerless, they must begin to acknowledge their problem solving as well as their leadership capabilities. In conclusion, we must first become conscious of how it is we play out the Drama Triangle. For where ever there is dysfunction, the Drama Triangle is found. Making ourselves aware of our starting gate positions is the first step to moving out of destructive patterns. As we begin the process of liberating ourselves from our stuckness through self-responsibility and truth telling, we transform our lives. In other words, we actualize our Higher Selves, thus realizing the blueprint of possibility that lies dormant within each of us.","title":"Getting Off the Triangle"},{"location":"C2-Reality/ToolsToHelpYouOwnYourOwnReality/","tags":["Reality"],"text":"Tools to help you own your own reality Who you are - Your sense of self - Your body, thinking, feeling and behavior.

When you notice an ANT enter your mind, recognize it and talk back to it. When you hear yourself say an ANT, stop and correct yourself. All or Nothing These are the ANTs that infest your brain when you think everything is good or all bad. It is the same as black or white thinking. If you stick to your exercise plan for a month, you think you think you are the most disciplined person on the planet. If you miss a day at the gym, you think you have no discipline and give up and go back to being a coach potato. A better approach is to acknowledge that you didn\u2019t do your daily workout and then get back on track the following day. One slip up doesn\u2019t mean you should give up entirely. Always Thinking This is when you think in words that over generalize, such as always, never, every time or everyone. Consider some of the thoughts such as \u201cI will never lose weight,\u201d \u201cI have always had a sweet tooth \u2013 I will never be able to stop eating chocolate,\u201d This kind of thinking makes you feel like you are doomed to fail at eating right and staying healthy. It is as if you have no control over your actions or behaviors. Focusing on the Negative This ANT makes you see only the negative aspects of situations even when there are plenty of positives. \u201cI know I lost 10 pounds, but I wanted to lose 15, so I\u2019m a failure\u201d is an example of this type of thinking. Focusing on the negative makes you more inclined to give up on your efforts. Putting a positive spin on this same thought \u2013 \u201cwow!\u201d I lost 10 pounds. I\u2019m on my way to my goal of 15 pounds\u201d \u2013 encourages you to keep up the good work and makes you feel pretty good about yourself. Thinking with your Feelings \u201cI feel like my skin is never going to clear up.\u201d Thoughts like this occur when you have a feeling about something and you assume it is correct, so you never question it. Feelings can lie too. Look for evidence. In this example, schedule an appointment with a dermatologist to find out if there\u2019s anything you can do to improve your skin. Guilt Beating Thinking in words like \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cmust\u201d, \u201cought to\u201d, and \u201chave to\u201d are typical with this type of ANT, which involves using excessive guilt to control behavior. When we feel pushed to do things, our natural tendency is to push back. That doesn\u2019t mean that guilt is all bad. There are certainly things in life that we should and shouldn\u2019t do if we want to have the best body possible: \u201cI want to eat the chips and guacamole at the party, but I should have the raw carrots instead\u201d or \u201cI feel like staying in bed, but I should do my workout.\u201d Don\u2019t mistake these for guilt beating ANTs. Labelling When you call yourself or someone else names or use negative terms to describe them, you have a labelling ANT in your brain. A lot of us do this on a regular basis. You may have said one of the following at some point in your life; \u201cI\u2019m a loser\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m a failure\u201d; or \u201cI\u2019m lazy.\u201d The problem with calling yourself names is that it takes away your actions and behaviors. If you are a loser, a failure, or lazy, then why bother trying to change your behavior? It is as if you have given up before you have even tried. This defeatist attitude can be ruinous for your body. BEWARE of the \"red ANTs\" Fortune-Telling Predicting the worst even though you don\u2019t know what will happen is the hallmark of the fortune telling ANT.

Mind Reading When you think that you know what somebody else is thinking even though they have not told you, and you have not asked them, it is called mind-reading. Listen carefully to the other person before trying to predict what they have to say. Blame Of all the ANTs, this one is the worst. Blaming others for your problems and taking no responsibility for your own successes and failures is toxic thinking. For example: \u201cIt is your fault I\u2019m out of shape because you will not go with me to exercise.\u201d Whenever you begin a sentence with \u201cit is your fault...\u201d it ruins your life.

Since the wounds from shame are frequently deep and long lasting, it will take a while to feel better. Become fully aware of your shame. Shame is not easy to face. After all, who wants to study exactly how one holds oneself in contempt?...We will have to examine our shame even though our natural impulse is to hide from it. Notice your defenses against shame. Shamed people often develop survival strategies that lessen their awareness of shame. These defenses minimize immediate pain at the cost of ignoring reality. Common defenses against shame are: denial, rage, perfectionism, arrogance, and exhibitionism. Investigate the sources of your shame. Shame has many sources: our genetic and biological composition our families of origin society\u2019s expectations and demands current relationships ourselves It is valuable to sort through these because each leads to different healing strategies. Accept your shame as part of the human condition. The understanding part of resolving shame ends when we accept ourselves as human beings who occasionally feel ashamed. Our shame won\u2019t go away by our fearing, hating, and fighting it. In fact, it could even grow stronger if we fight it. Action Phase Get some help - you don\u2019t have to do this alone. Isolation is a common reaction to feelings of shame. The more deeply a person is shamed, the more she will tend to hide her thoughts, feelings, and actions from others....In general, damage from shame begins to heal when that shame is exposed to others in a safe environment. Challenge the shame. The message that challenges shame will be different for each of us, but its general form is this: I respect and appreciate the shame inside me, even though it often brings me pain. I know that shame is part of me. But I also am a person who has the right to feel good about myself. I have value as a human being. I deserve to be treated with respect, honor, and dignity by the people around me and by myself. I will no longer live a life centered on my shame. Set positive goals based on humanity, humility, autonomy, and competence. Everyone belongs to the human race. There are no exceptions. All human beings are equal - no person is better or worse than another. Each of us has the right and responsibility to decide how to live our lives. Every person is good enough to contribute some value to the world. Take mental and physical action toward these goals. We begin recovering from our shame when we decide we want to live by these principles. We ask ourselves how we can change our thoughts and behaviors so we can eventually feel more human, humble, autonomous, and competent. Review your progress regularly Be patient with your shame but don\u2019t forget about it. Deeply ingrained shame habits are hard to break, and they could sneak back into your life. That is why regular review sessions are helpful. Remember that shame often heals better in the company of others.","title":"Healing Wounds Of Shame"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/HealingWoundsOfShame/#healing-wounds-of-shame","text":"","title":"Healing Wounds Of Shame"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/HealingWoundsOfShame/#from-letting-go-of-shame-by-ronald-and-patricia-potter-efron","text":"","title":"From Letting Go of Shame by Ronald and Patricia Potter-Efron"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/HealingWoundsOfShame/#understanding-phase","text":"Be Patient - shame heals slowly Shame is about a person\u2019s identity as a human being.

Obviously, the circumstances are going to have an influence on how one chooses to deal with anger. There are three general styles in which people can handle anger: Repressed Anger Many people are afraid of anger and try to avoid it at all costs. When the emotion surfaces, they do their best to pretend it is not there. Their reasoning (conscious or subconscious) is that if one ignores anger, it will go away. Most of these people either have been taught openly to avoid anger or have learned through bitter experience how painful anger can be. Repression is a form of denial . If a person denies that he is angry, then he feels no obligation to deal with his anger. The problem is solved (temporarily). Repression may have its short-term rewards, but in the long run repressed anger is usually especially powerful and bitter. By repressing it, a person is pushing anger from the conscious to the subconscious. There it can fester and worsen without that person\u2019s knowledge. 2. Expressed Anger As a culture, Americans are quickly losing any sense of bashfulness. The prevailing mood is that if you have been offended, get angry! Certainly, we are in a period where it is acceptable, even fashionable, to \u201clet it all hang out.\u201d Anger can be assertive, or it can be aggressive. Assertive anger means that people stand up for their convictions in a manner that respects another\u2019s dignity. Aggressive anger may also be stated firmly, but without true regard for the other person\u2019s worth. Therefore, when people express anger, that expression may be correct or incorrect, depending on the level of sensitivity to others. Nonetheless, expressed anger is anger that is communicated outwardly . Certain guidelines should be followed to make sure that expressed anger works for us instead of against us. Be sure that when you express anger you do not attempt to establish your own sense of superiority. This could cause the recipient of your anger to harbor resentment. Make sure your anger has a constructive aim. Anger expressed for the sake of meanness is just going to create an atmosphere that will breed more anger. Be aware of the responsiveness of the recipient. Make sure the other party is ready to hear what you have to say. Consider the feelings and circumstances of the recipient. There will be times when your anger may be completely correct, but you will not be able to communicate it constructively due to the mind-set of the other person. Released Anger Released anger refers to anger that is dismissed or let go. It is not to be confused with repressed anger. Repressed anger is simply pushed into the subconscious mind. But when anger is released, the person has made the conscious decision that anger is no longer needed and it is therefore dropped. People can gain the ability to release anger only after they first gain some mastery of the art of expressing anger. After anger has served its purpose (or if one sees that it has no good purpose) the mature individual will have enough sense to let go of it. Understanding the three general ways of handling anger makes it possible for you to examine your patterns of dealing with anger. Certainly, it is not always best to express anger. There are times when that would do more harm than good. It definitely is not best to try to repress anger so that it is merely out of the conscious mind. And there are times when it is right and times when it is wrong to release it. We each need to come up with our own personalized game plan for how we will handle anger. The better control we have over it, the more anger will work in our favor.","title":"How To Handle Anger"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/HowToHandleAnger/#how-to-handle-anger","text":"","title":"How To Handle Anger"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/HowToHandleAnger/#from-good-n-angry-how-to-handle-your-anger-positively-by-les-carter","text":"There is no one correct way to handle anger.

Originally God gave it to mankind to serve the redemptive purpose of bringing all individuals into the right fellowship with Him. Through guilt we are each challenged to come to grips with the sense of right and wrong established by God. In both His written Word and each person's sense of conscience, God reveals the basic laws of morality and truth and exhorts individuals to draw close to Him. Just as physical pain communicates that something is amiss in one's body, guilt can communicate that all is not right in one's style of living and thinking. It is important to understand that there are two kinds of guilt: True guilt is the constructive feeling of remorse based on a reasonable understanding of God's standard of right and wrong. For example, when a person tells a lie, he feels guilty. Inwardly he knows that he has violated one of God's directives. Therefore, because of his sense of regret, he atones for his error, making the necessary corrections. True guilt is the inner voice that instructs the individual to choose right over wrong. It is the emotion that leads a person to live a life of moral responsibility. False guilt is a feeling of remorse that assumes a judgmental posture toward oneself (note that judging is entirely different from examining oneself). False guilt involves a subjective condemnation in light of the fact that a wrong has been committed. Attached to false guilt is the fear of being found out and the fear of receiving harsh punishment. This type of guilt usually has negative repercussions because it hinders a person from accepting the fullness of God's forgiveness. The experience of false guilt is inappropriate because it encourages a person to feel that he has no value because of personal sins. Notice the differences between true guilt and false guilt. Whereas true guilt causes a person to draw closer to God, false guilt creates a sense of isolation or estrangement from Him. True guilt brings improvement to a person's life; false guilt causes life to lose its joy. True guilt produces a humble, repentant spirit; false guilt produces feelings of defeat and degradation.","title":"Letting Go Of Guilt"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/LettingGoOfGuilt/#letting-go-of-guilt","text":"","title":"Letting Go Of Guilt"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/LettingGoOfGuilt/#from-mind-over-emotions-by-dr-les-carter","text":"Although some guilt can be totally debilitating, this emotion is given to us for positive reasons.

A memo to see the boss means you're going to get fired. Catastrophizing results from having no boundaries or sense of worth. There are no limits to the \"what ifs\" that can occur. The most logical counter to catastrophizing is an honest assessment in terms of realistic odds or percent of probability. What are the chances? One in a thousand (1%) or one in 100,000 (.001%)? Mind-Reading You make assumptions (without evidence) about how people are reacting to you. \"I can tell by their faces, that they're getting ready to fire me.\" \"She thinks I'm immature or she wouldn't ask me these questions.\" These assumptions are usually born of intuition, hunches, vague misgivings, or one or two past experiences. Mind-reading depends on projection. You imagine that people feel as bad about you as you do about yourself. As a shame-based person, you are critical and judgmental of yourself. You assume others feel the same way about you. Mind-reading is a form of imagining and fantasizing. In the long run you're best off making no inferences about people. Treat all your interpretations about other people as hallucinations. Use that word when you give your interpretation. The best policy is to check out the evidence for your conclusion. Personalization Shame-based people are egocentric. They relate everything to themselves. Personalization involves the habit of continually comparing yourself to other people. This is a consequence of the perfectionistic system that fosters shame. A perfectionistic system demands comparison. The list of comparisons never ends. The underlying assumption is that your worth is questionable. Force yourself to get evidence to prove what the boss's frown means. Check it out if possible. Abandon the habit of comparing. Make no conclusion unless you have reasonable evidence and proof. Overgeneralization This distortion results from the toxic shame's grandiosity. One slipped stitch means. \"I'll never learn to sew.\" A turn-down for a date means \"Nobody will ever go out with me.\" In this thinking distortion you make a broad, generalized conclusion based on a single incident or piece of evidence. Write on a 3X5 card, \"There Are No Absolutes\" and put it on your desk. Challenge words like all, every, never, always, nobody, everybody by exaggerating them. Say: Do I really mean I never, never, never, etc? Learn to use words like maybe, sometimes, often. Either/Or Thinking Another consequence of shame-based grandiosity is polarized thinking or either/or thinking. The chief mark of this thought distortion is an insistence on dichotomous choices: You perceive everything in extremes. There is no middle ground. People and things are either good or bad, wonderful or terrible. The most destructive aspect of this thought distortion is its impact on how you judge yourself. If you're not brilliant or error-free, then you must be a failure. There is no room for mistakes. There are no black and white judgements. The world is grey. Think in terms of percentages. About 5% of the time I'm selfish, but the rest of the time I'm loving and generous. Being Right As a shame-based person, you must continually prove that your viewpoint and actions are correct. You live in a completely defensive posture. Since you cannot make a mistake, you aren't interested in the truth of other opinions, only in defending your own. This thought distortion really keeps you in the shame squirrel cage, because you rarely hear any new information. You get no new data that would help you change your belief system about yourself. Own your own good healthy shame. If you're always right, you stop listening and learning. The key to overcoming being right is to become an active listener. As an active listener you listen for the content as well as the process. You learn to listen with your ears as well as your eyes. You learn to give feedback and to check things out. This helps us to grasp the other's point of view. It is important to remember that others believe what they are saying as strongly as we believe our own convictions. I like to ask myself, \"What can I learn from the other person's opinion?\" \"Should\" Thinking Should thinking is a direct result of perfectionism. In this thought distortion you operate from a list of inflexible rules about how you and other people should act. The rules are right and indisputable. The most common cue words for this thought distortion are should, ought, and must. A shame-based person with this thought distortion makes both himself and others miserable. Use the words should, ought, and must as red flags. Flexible rules and expectations don't use these words because there are always exceptions and special circumstances. Rigidity is a mark of mental illness; flexibility is the mark of mental health. Without flexibility, there is no freedom. Control Thinking Fallacies Control is a major cover up for toxic shame. Control is a product of grandiosity and distorts thinking in two ways. You see yourself as helpless and externally controlled or as omnipotent and responsible foreverythingaroundyou. Youdon'tbelievethatyouhaveanyrealcontrolovertheoutcomeofyour life. Thiskeepsyoustuckandinyourshamecycle. Theoppositefallacyisthefallacyofomnipotent control. You feel responsible for everything and everybody. You carry the world on your shoulders and feel guilty when it doesn't work out. Aside from acts of God, you are responsible for what happens in your world. Learning to be responsible and to allow others that privilege is to live in reality. Ask yourself, \"What choices have I made that resulted in this situation? What decisions can I now make to change it?\" Also remember that respect for others means letting them live their own lives, suffer their own pains and solve their own problems. Cognitive Deficiency or Filtering You pick out one element of a situation to the exclusion of everything else. The detail you pick out supports your belief about your personal defectiveness. Filtering is a way to magnify and \"awfulize\" your thoughts. This triggers powerful shame spirals. Stop using words like terrible, awful, disgusting, horrendous, etc. Write out the phrase \"No need to magnify. Icancope. Icanstandit.\" AfavoritephrasefromAbrahamLowis\"Thisisdistressing,but not dangerous.\" To stop filtering you have to shift focus. Place your attention on coping strategies to deal with the problem rather than obsessing on the problem itself. Blaming and Global Labeling Blaming is a cover-up for shame and a way to pass it on to others. Blaming lends itself to global labeling. Your grocery store has rotten food. The prices are a rip-off. A reserved and quiet person on a date is a dull wallflower. Your boss is a gutless dumbo. Accept responsibility for your own behavior and choices. Focus on your own problems. Look at the beam in your own eye, rather than the speck in your brother's eye. When you start labeling, ask yourself \"What am I trying to avoid?\" If you find you are not avoiding, be specific rather than global. My boss is often conservative. He is rarely a risk-taker. This is accurate. Calling him a gutless dumbo is about your need to vent anger at your own situation by having to answer to him.","title":"Shame-Based Distorted Thinking"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/ShameBasedDistortedThinking/#shame-based-distorted-thinking","text":"","title":"Shame-Based Distorted Thinking"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/ShameBasedDistortedThinking/#from-healing-the-shame-that-binds-you-by-john-bradshaw","text":"","title":"From Healing The Shame That Binds You by John Bradshaw"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/ShameBasedDistortedThinking/#catastrophizing","text":"A headache signals an impending brain tumor.

Those of us recovering from adult children and codependency issues frequently have a cesspool of unresolved pain from the past. We have feelings, sometimes from early childhood to the present, that either hurt too much to feel or that we had no support and permission to deal with. There are other inevitable sources of pain in our life too. There is the sadness and grief that comes when we experience change, even good change, as we let go of one part of our life and begin our journey into the new. There is the pain that leads and guides us into better choices for our future. We have many choices about how to stop this pain. We may have experimented with different options. Compulsive and addictive behaviors stop pain - temporarily. We may have used alcohol, other drugs, relationships, or sex to stop our pain.

We can stop the behaviors we are doing that cause pain, if that's appropriate. We can make a decision to remove ourselves from situations that cause repeated, similar pain. We can learn the lesson our pain is trying to teach us. If we are being pelted by pain, there is a lesson. Trust that idea. Something is being worked out in us. The answer will not come from addictive or other compulsive behaviors; we will receive the answer when we feel our feelings. It takes courage to be willing to stand still and feel what we must feel. Sometimes, we have what seems like endless layers of pain inside us. Pain hurts. Grief hurts. Sadness hurts. It does not feel good. But neither does denying what is already there; neither does living a lifetime with old and new pockets of pain packed, stored, and stacked within. It will only hurt for a while, no longer than necessary, to heal us. We can trust that if we must feel pain, it is a part of healing, and it is good. We can become willing to surrender to and accept the inevitable painful feelings that are a good part of recovery. Go with the flow, even when the flow takes us through uncomfortable feelings. Release, freedom, healing, and good feelings are on the other side. Today, I am open and willing to feel what I need to feel. I am willing to stop my compulsive behaviors.

Those of us recovering from adult children and codependency issues frequently have a cesspool of unresolved pain from the past. We have feelings, sometimes from early childhood to the present, that either hurt too much to feel or that we had no support and permission to deal with. There are other inevitable sources of pain in our life too. There is the sadness and grief that comes when we experience change, even good change, as we let go of one part of our life and begin our journey into the new. There is the pain that leads and guides us into better choices for our future. We have many choices about how to stop this pain. We may have experimented with different options. Compulsive and addictive behaviors stop pain - temporarily. We may have used alcohol, other drugs, relationships, or sex to stop our pain.

Besides the fact that we now carry feelings induced in us during childhood, the fact that our emotions are generated from our thoughts also influences our damaged and exaggerated feeling reality. This process of generating feelings from the way we interpret the events around us automatically leads to trouble for doependents, because the experience of being abused damages our thinking . The process of assigning meaning to the events in our lives is skewed and the conclusions we draw are often inaccurate - but we don't know it. We believe our thinking is fine. But in fact our emotional responses to other people's actions toward us often seem bizarre to them. In the process of generating feelings, we first bring some data into our innter world with one of our five senses... We draw conclusions, and interpretations and give meaning to what we heard, saw, tasted, smelled, or felt. Out of this thinking comes our emotions about our thoughts. As a result of our emotions, we choose a behavior... We cannot change our emotions. What we feel is what we feel. In fact it is dysfunctional to try not to be angry or not to be afraid when that is what we feel. To deal with an emotion we must acknowledge that we feel it and learn to express it appropriately. But we can examine the thinking we are doing that leads to the emotion. We can often choose a different behavior after we've had our feelings. Examining the thinking is far more effective in reducing the intensity of emotions we feel than changing our behavior... We must also try to express our emptions with healthy, nonabusive behaviors no matter what is triggering them. What I seldom realize as a codependent is that because of my childhood abuse I tend to put a negative interpretation on incoming data when a positive interpretation might be far more accurate. I \"transform\" incoming data as it goes through the grid of my abused past. I take the perception into my mind and give it meaning very different from what a functional person would give it. For example, when someone gives me a genuine complement, because of my past abuse I can transform it into a subtle insult by labeling the remark as sarcasm. To make matters worse, I have no idea that I just did that; I think my brain is working perfectly well. I think it was sarcasm until the evidence is overwhelming that it was not. Add to the fact that out of this feeling reality based on skewed thinking we then act, it's easy to see how we codependents are automatically set up for trouble and also don't understand why we're in trouble. We think we're acting quite normally. Consequently a relationship we have with a more functional person can be chaotic for that person as well as for us. On top of it all, we think they are acting strangely, being unreasonable or hypercritical.","title":"What Generates Feelings?"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/WhatGeneratesFeelings/#what-generates-feelings","text":"Besides the fact that we now carry feelings induced in us during childhood, the fact that our emotions are generated from our thoughts also influences our damaged and exaggerated feeling reality.

God uses this boundary. We choose to allow or not and practice boundaries, choices, limits. Rev: 3:20 \"Behold I stand at the door and knock. If anyone opens the door I will come in and sup with him and he with me.\" None: No Boundaries. They have no sense of being abused or of being abusive. Such people have trouble saying No or protecting themselves. They allow others to take advantage of them physically, sexually, emotionally, or intellectually without clear knowledge that they have the right to say, \"Stop that, I don't want to be touched\" or \"I am not responsible for your feelings, thoughts, or behavior\". A codependent with No boundaries not only lacks protection but has not ability to recognize another person's right to have boundaries with the codependent. Therefore, they move through other peoples boundaries unaware that they are doing something inappropriate. Life crashes in doesn't know own Reality. Victim/Abuser/Rescuer Partial: Partial Boundaries. People with damaged boundaries can at times or with certain individuals say No, set limits and take care of themselves. At other times or with other people they are powerless to set boundaries. For instance, they may be able to set boundaries with everyone but authority figures, or his/her spouse, or his/her child. In addition to, in certain circumstances they become offenders, stepping into someone else's life and trying to control it or manipulate it. Walls: Walls are most often made up of either Anger or Fear. Anger: People who use a wall of Anger give off the message (either verbally or nonverbally), if you come near me or say anything about such-and-such, I'll explode! I might hit you or yell at you, so watch out! Others are afraid to approach for fear of triggering that anger. Fear: People who use a wall of fear retreat from others to keep safe. Such people don't go to parties, don't hang around after meetings to chat. They emit an energy field that says don't come near me, or I'll fall apart. I'm so fragile and afraid that I can't handle contact with anyone. Unfortunately, an offender is attracted to a person like this, like a red cape to a bull. So this is not an effective method of protection from offenders. Silence: The person using a wall of silence becomes quiet and does not emit an energy field of emotion like the people using fear or anger, they fade into the woodwork. Another example would be some using the \"silent treatment\" Words: The person using a wall of words often just talks right on, even when someone politely tries to contribute to the conversation by making a comment or changing the subject. Talks over others and may ask a question and talk right over the answer. It is also quite common for a person to move from one kind of wall to another, switching from anger to fear, words, or silence at any time , though always remaining invulnerable behind the walls. After a period of loneliness they may venture out get pinged and quickly retreat back.

When we think of relationships, we think of love. When we think of boundaries, we think of limits. Boundaries give us a sense of what is part of us and what is not a part of us, what we will allow and what we won't, what we will choose to do and what we will choose not to do. Boundary systems (according to Pia Mellody in her book Facing Codependense ) are invisible and symbolic \"fences\" that have three purposes: (1) to keep people from coming into our space and abusing us, (2) to keep us from going into the space of others and abusing them and (3) to give each of us a way to embody our sense of \"who we are\". Boundary systems have two parts: external and internal Our external boundary allows us to choose our distance from other people and enables us to give or refuse permission for them to touch us. Our external boundary also keeps our bodies from offending someone else's body. The external boundary is divided into two parts: physical and sexual. The physical part of our external boundary controls how close we let people come to us and whether they can touch us or not. Also, if we have intact external boundaries, we know to ask permisssion to touch other people and we are careful not to stand too close to them for their comfort.

When we think of boundaries, we think of limits. Boundaries give us a sense of what is part of us and what is not a part of us, what we will allow and what we won't, what we will choose to do and what we will choose not to do. Boundary systems (according to Pia Mellody in her book Facing Codependense ) are invisible and symbolic \"fences\" that have three purposes: (1) to keep people from coming into our space and abusing us, (2) to keep us from going into the space of others and abusing them and (3) to give each of us a way to embody our sense of \"who we are\". Boundary systems have two parts: external and internal Our external boundary allows us to choose our distance from other people and enables us to give or refuse permission for them to touch us. Our external boundary also keeps our bodies from offending someone else's body. The external boundary is divided into two parts: physical and sexual. The physical part of our external boundary controls how close we let people come to us and whether they can touch us or not. Also, if we have intact external boundaries, we know to ask permisssion to touch other people and we are careful not to stand too close to them for their comfort. In a similar way, our sexual boundary controls sexual distanct and touch Our internal boundary protects our thinking, feelings, and behavior and keeps them functional. When we are using our internal boundary, we can take responsibility for our thinking, feelings, and behavior and keep them separate from that of others, and stop blaming them for what we think, feel and do.

Keith Miller Each of us has basic needs and individual wants that are our responsibility to satisfy. Needs are the things we must have to survive. All people have dependency needs, children as well as adults. The difference between a child's dependency needs and those of an adult is that the child must have his or her needs met initially by his or her major caregiver and be taught how to take care of each one in the course of growing up. An adult is responsible for knowing how to address each need and asking for help when help is truly needed. The dependency needs for adults are food, shelter, clothing, medical/dental attention, physical nurturing, emotional nurturing (time, attention, and direction from others), sex, and financial resources (earning, saving, spending, budgeting and investing money). There are some needs that can only be met through interaction with another person, such as physical nurturing or emotional nurturing . But we must be taught that it is our responsibility to recognize those needs and ask someone appropriate to meet them. We in turn must learn to meet others' needs at appropriate times in proper circumstances, which is called interdependence. Wants can be divided into two categories: little wants and big wants. Little wants are truly preferences. They are things we don't have to have, but when we choose them they bring us great joy. The big wants take our lives in a general direction and bring us fulfillment. They include such things as \"I want to be married to this person.\" \" I want to be a doctor.\" \"I want to develop this corporation.\" \"I want to have a child.\" The four categories of difficulty acknowledging and meeting our wants and needs: We experience not being in touch with our needs and wants in one of four different ways according to the experiences we had in childhood. I am too dependent . I know my needs or wants but expect other people to take care of them for me, and I wait, expecting them to know to do so as I do not take care of them myself. I am anti dependent . I am able to acknowledge to myself that I have needs and wants, but I try to meet them myself and am unable to accept help or guidance from anyone else. I'd rather go without the thing needed or wanted than be vulnerable and ask for help. I am needless and wantless . Although I have needs or wants, I am not aware of them. I get my wants and needs confused . I know what I want and I get it, but I don't know what I need. For example, I try to take care of my needs that I am unaware of by buying everything I want. Though I may need physical nurturing, I buy some new clothes instead. Not tending to one's needs and wants appropriately is often connected to a feeling of low self-esteem (shame). Whenever the \"adult child\" feels needy or has a want shame flares at the onset of the experience of needing or wanting. This shame originally came from childhood experiences, when expressing a need or want was met with abuse by a caregiver - even though that memory of abuse has long been \"forgotten,\" is no longer conscious. The adult codependent feels as if he or she is terribly selfish to need or want something, however legitimate it may be. Where difficulty acknowledging and meeting our wants and needs comes from: Children who had all their needs and wants taken care of by their parents instead of having the parents teach them to meet their own needs in proper ways usually experience being too dependent in adulthood. The parent became enmeshed with the child by taking total care of him or her and not explaining anything to or expecting anything of the child. Children who experienced a parent attacking them for having and expressing needs and wants usually become anti dependent upon reaching adulthood. Children whose needs and wants were ignored or neglected by their caregivers usually experience being needless and wantless on reaching adulthood. Such children were not even aware of their own needs because they never were identified. As adults, they often work hard to take care of the needs of others without giving any attention to their own needs and wants. Occasionally at some level these codependents expect that others will reciprocate and take care of them. And they often get angry when this doesn't happen. Many times the codependents are so needless and wantless that they are not even aware of this expectation. If needs occur to them, guilt often ensues. They are completely deluded about the whole question of what they may need or want and how to meet those needs and wants directly. Confusing needs with wants is the experience of children who get everything they want but almost nothing of what they need. Often these are the children of wealthy families in which the parents didn't meet the children's interactive needs (such as physical nurturing and emotional nurturing).","title":"Difficulty acknowledging and meeting our own needs and wants"},{"location":"C5-SelfCare/DifficultyAknowledingNeedsWants/#difficulty-acknowledging-and-meeting-our-own-needs-and-wants","text":"","title":"Difficulty acknowledging and meeting our own needs and wants"},{"location":"C5-SelfCare/DifficultyAknowledingNeedsWants/#from-facing-codependence-by-pia-mellody-andrea-miller-j-keith-miller","text":"Each of us has basic needs and individual wants that are our responsibility to satisfy.

The time is past for \"inherited beliefs\"; it is time for an adult faith. We need to look into why we think what we think and why we believe what we believe. Is it because we really believe it, or because someone told us to believe it? Disagree with authority figures Be honest about your disagreements with others. Allow yourself freedom of thought, and do not call yourself \"bad\" for your opinions. No one is right about everything, and we all go through periods of reshaping what we think on any topic. Speak your options, and listen to the criticism. Speaking out may help you shape your views, or you may help shape others' views. Critique others' thoughts as well. Disagreement is healthy, and \"iron sharpens iron\" See parents and authority figures realistically Knock parents and other authority figures off the pedistal you've put them on. See their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Confess the sins of your fathers and then forgive them. Disagree with bad patterns, call them sin, and be different from the generations that went before. Make your own decisions You are an adult; learn to think and act for yourself Practice disagreeing Be aware of the times when someone is parenting you, and say what you are thinking. You do not have to be mean or even confrontational. Just say, \"Well, I see your point, but I look at it differently, I think...\" Deal with your sexuality Work on reeducating yourself about the beauty of sex; desensitize yourself to the \"no-no\" attitude you have toward it. If you feel ashamed, you may still be in a preadolescent stage regarding sex. Give yourself permission to be equal with your parents Many authority problems have as their kernel the inability to assume the role held by the same- sex parent. You either dislike the way this parent functioned in the role, or you are afraid of taking the role over. In either instance, this is the role you were born to assume, the adult role of your gender. Look at the ways that your parents fulfilled this role. Appreciate where your parents succeeded, and choose other role models for where he or she failed. This will help your transition from child to adult. Recognize and purse talents To become and adult requires that you own and recognize the talents and gifts God has given you. To develop your expertise, you must take the talents God has given you, and do something. Practice You can't learn to be an authority and have expertise in any area if you don't have the freedom to practice and learn. Give yourself permission to fail. No one ever became an expert in any area without trial and error. Recognize the privileges of adulthood When people realize how much freedom their child position is costing them - freedom to develop as God intended without approval from other adults - the one down position starts to look like prison. Remaining in a child position is safe because others do all the thinking for you; all you have to do is lose your self-respect. Adults have freedom to choose their own talents, values, beliefs, and relationship with God, tastes, friends, and church. They also can express God-given aspects of themselves, such as feelings and sexuality without inhibition and fear, or need for approval from anyone else. They can be themselves. Discipline yourself Adults discipline themselves. If you lacked discipline when growing up, you may need to learn discipline now. Get a friend to hold you accountable in this area; agree on something you are going to be disciplined to do, and have some built-in consequences if you don't. Submit to others out of freedom An important aspect of becoming an adult is to learn to submit to others in love, without an authority conflict. This includes government, spouses, friends, evil people, bosses, and God. When we submit in love, we are displaying our freedom; if we submit out of compliance, it is not true submission. It's slavery. Submitting to others as God has ordained is identity affirming Do good works You have some expertise, and using it for good works will help you realize your adulthood. Become a \"Pharisee Buster\" We all have remnants of legalistic thinking and remain under the tutor of paternal approval. Try to find ways you may still be operating under the old system of gaining approval in order to be okay. Look for legalism that has crept into your faith and ways that you are being \"made for the Sabbath\". Let go of the ways you are trying to earn approval; they can only eat away at your soul. Appreciate mystery and the unknown One of the hallmarks of people with authority problems is their inability to tolerate mystery and the unknown. They need an answer for everything, and everything has to be wrapped up in neat little packages. Jesus kept trying to shake the Pharisees out of this rigidity. Love and appreciate people who are different People often see other people as not as good because they are still trying to be the better child. When you can appreciate other people who are different from you, you have stopped sibling rivalry - the childhood battle of trying to assume an equal stance with your adult brother and sister.","title":"Skills for becoming an adult"},{"location":"C5-SelfCare/SkillForBecomingAnAdult/#skills-for-becoming-an-adult","text":"","title":"Skills for becoming an adult"},{"location":"C5-SelfCare/SkillForBecomingAnAdult/#from-changes-that-heal-by-dr-henry-cloud","text":"","title":"From Changes That Heal by Dr. Henry Cloud"},{"location":"C5-SelfCare/SkillForBecomingAnAdult/#re-evaluate-beliefs","text":"We need to re-evaluate what we believe.

Keith Miller Not knowing how to be moderate is possibly the most visible symptom of codependence to other people. This symptom has manifestations in all four areas of reality. Body Many codependents dress immoderately Thinking Codependents think in terms of black or white, right or wrong, good or bad; there are few gray areas. Feelings The heart and soul of codependence lies in the difficulty codependents have knowing what their feelings ar and how to share them. Codependents seem to have the most difficulty experiencing feelings moderately; they feel little or no emotions or have explosive or agonizing ones. There are four different kinds of feeling reality that codependents experience. And until one can recognize these four kinds of feelings and where they come from, life can be very baffling and confusing for a codependent . 1. Adult Feeling Reality - Adult feeling reality is a mature authentic emotional response to your thinking. It is not dysfunctional or codependent. These feelings are usually moderate when you experience them and cause you to feel centered within yourself. 2. Adult-Induced Feeling Reality - In functinoal people, adult-induced feelings are the result of a process called empathy . As a healthy adult, you can be empathetic with someone else as that person shares his or her feelings because you can experience that person's feelings with him or her a little bit. 3. Frozen Feelings From Childhood - One way this occurs is that the feelings elicited in a child during abuse are so overwhelming and miserable that the child shuts down or \"freezes\" the feelings in order to survive. Another way this might happen is that the child may be attacked physically, verbally, or both for having or showing feelings. The feelings involved are usually anger, pain, or fear. 4. Adult-to-Child Carried Feelings - Children also absorb feelings such as shame, rage, fear, and pain from the adult who is abusing them. These feelings remain within the person into adulthood and are called \"carried\" feelings, because they've been carried forward from childhood. When you are having this form of codependent feeling reality, you feel overwhelmed and out of control.

Your Thinking - is it extreme, disordered, irrational, black & white, right or wrong, good or bad, or inordinate thinking? Moderating this may require professional help. 3.

Keith Miller Healty self-esteem is the internal experience of one's own preciousness and value as a person. It comes from inside a person and moves outward into relationships. Healthy people know that they are valuable and precious even when they make a mistake, are confronted by an angry person, are cheated or lied to, or are rejected by a lover, friend, parent, child, or boss. Healthy individuals may feel other emotions, such as guilt, fear, anger, and pain in these circumstances, but the sense of self-esteem remains intact. Codependents experience difficulty with self-esteem at one or both extremes. At one extreme self-esteem is low or nonexistent: you think that you are worth less than others. At the opposite extreme is arrogance and grandiosity: you think you are set apart and superior to other people. Low self-esteem comes from dysfunctional caregivers giving their children verbal or nonverbal messages that they are \"less-than\" people. These messages from the caregivers become part of the children's own opinion of themselves. Upon reaching adulthood, it is almost impossible for those raised with \"less-than\" messages to be able to generate the feeling from within that they have value. Arrogant and grandiose behavior arises out of one of two distinct situations. In the first, a family system teaches its children to find fault with others.

Other-esteem is based on either one's \"human doing\" or in the opinions and behavior of other people.

It is when someone is on our side, is for us instead of against us, and is showing favor towards us that is unmerited. In other words, there is nothing that you do to gain it. It is given freely. In terms of God, it has to do with his relational character, that He is a God of love. He desires relationship with us, and He gives it freely to us. He desires to connect and be with us, and because of His grace, he desires to give to us and to help us. When we are growing, it is because God is bestowing some gift of grace to us in some various form and that gift is something that is unearned. It may be the gift of love shown in salvation and forgiveness. Or it may be the gift of a talent that he has bestowed on you. It may be an opportunity to take a class or to have an experience, or it may be the love of a person. Gods gifts of Grace come in many forms to us, through direct intervention by Him, or through His use of people in our lives. As Peter tells us, when we are receiving love and help from other people, that is the grace of God being given to us. (1 Peter 4:10) Whatever the form of grace that you have or need in your process, the essence of grace must be present; unmerited favor. What that means is that you need people and support in your growth process who are for you and not against you. You need some people and God on your side no matter how you are doing. That is the unmerited part of grace. When you are growing, and getting help depends on your performance, that is a Catch-22. You have to have help to get better, and if you have to get better to get the help, you don't have a chance. So, in evaluating your system of growth, you may ask yourself the question am I getting help and support that is going to be there regardless of how I am doing? Help that, I do not have to earn? This is getting the nutrients that we need in order to grow from outside of ourselves, from God and His people. There are many aspects of this help described in the Bible, too many to name here. But here is a short list of some of the more basic ways that we experience grace in the growth process. Unconditional acceptance and forgiveness from God and other people.

You must find a place of unconditional love and acceptance,","title":"Grace"},{"location":"C8-GraceTruthTime/Grace/#grace","text":"Simply stated, is unmerited favor. It is when someone is on our side, is for us instead of against us, and is showing favor towards us that is unmerited. In other words, there is nothing that you do to gain it. It is given freely. In terms of God, it has to do with his relational character, that He is a God of love. He desires relationship with us, and He gives it freely to us. He desires to connect and be with us, and because of His grace, he desires to give to us and to help us. When we are growing, it is because God is bestowing some gift of grace to us in some various form and that gift is something that is unearned. It may be the gift of love shown in salvation and forgiveness. Or it may be the gift of a talent that he has bestowed on you. It may be an opportunity to take a class or to have an experience, or it may be the love of a person. Gods gifts of Grace come in many forms to us, through direct intervention by Him, or through His use of people in our lives. As Peter tells us, when we are receiving love and help from other people, that is the grace of God being given to us. (1 Peter 4:10) Whatever the form of grace that you have or need in your process, the essence of grace must be present; unmerited favor. What that means is that you need people and support in your growth process who are for you and not against you. You need some people and God on your side no matter how you are doing. That is the unmerited part of grace. When you are growing, and getting help depends on your performance, that is a Catch-22. You have to have help to get better, and if you have to get better to get the help, you don't have a chance. So, in evaluating your system of growth, you may ask yourself the question am I getting help and support that is going to be there regardless of how I am doing? Help that, I do not have to earn? This is getting the nutrients that we need in order to grow from outside of ourselves, from God and His people. There are many aspects of this help described in the Bible, too many to name here. But here is a short list of some of the more basic ways that we experience grace in the growth process. Unconditional acceptance and forgiveness from God and other people. (1John 1:9, James 5:16) Support and encouragement when we are too weak to make it on our own. (1 Thess 5:11, 14, Ecc 4: 9-11, Heb 10:25) Modeling and imparting skills in living, from others, (Heb 13:7) Correction and instruction.

The three ingredients of growth! When they all come together we can for the first time have the true self loved and accepted and grow in the likeness of God. Grace is the first ingredient. There's no way to earn it or deserve it, anymore than you can deserve the taste of raspberries and cream, or earn good looks or bring about your own birth. Grace is the unmerited favor of God, toward people. To put it another way, Grace is unconditional love and acceptance. Such love is the foundation upon which all healing of the human spirit rests. God loves us freely, without condition. It says that you are accepted just like you are and that you will not be shamed or incur wrath for whatever you are experiencing. Truth is the second ingredient necessary for growing up. Truth is what is real, it describes how things really are. Just as Grace is the relational aspect of God's character. Truth is the structural aspect of His character, the skeleton life hangs on. Truth implies many things, but in relationships it implies honesty, being real with one another, and living out the truth of God. Many people think that safe relationships are relationships that just give grace without confrontation, but ultimately these relationships can be destructive as well. We need safe people in our life that will be honest with us, telling us where we are wrong and where we need to change. Time is the third ingredient. The Bible tells us that in order for grace and truth to produce fruit we need a third element, time. Time joined by Grace and Truth. Time is not just an act of God's grace to us, \"giving us some space.\" He is much too loving to allow us to continue in sin for one minute longer than necessary. Time is not a luxury but a necessity. We will also learn about good and bad time and how all the ingredients work together. Helping us grow into Healthy Mature Adults and how to extend these things to ourselves and others. As we are growing into His image.","title":"Grace, Truth & Time"},{"location":"C8-GraceTruthTime/GraceTruthTime/#grace-truth-time","text":"","title":"Grace, Truth &amp; Time"},{"location":"C8-GraceTruthTime/GraceTruthTime/#what-are-they-and-why-are-they-so-important","text":"The three ingredients of growth!

When parents are absent or abusive, (Core Sypmtoms versus Blessings) we take that uncompleted aspect of our personality out of time. It goes underground and does not change until it is called out into good time, into time affected by grace and truth, where it can go through normal development. When the true self comes into grace, and truth giving relationships, that self can develop over time. Some people remember the specific time they decided to leave good time Others cannot specifically remember making a decision, but nevertheless, as a result of pain and injury, they were forced underground. They were pushed outside of time, and into a place where they could not experience certain years or own their true self. When an aspect of a person does not enter into time, this persons emotional maturity will stagnate at this level and or age. Stagnation is seen often in people who abuse substances such as drugs and alcohol. Their emotional development likely stopped at the age they began to escape life through substance abuse. One cannot grow when one no longer participates in life. The Bible contrasts good time and bad time: But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said God calls us out of the darkness into the light of experience with Jesus and His body. Then time can be good time; when combined with truth and grace, it can transform us and develop us as we need to be developed. If we hide, time is bad time, for it is not being redemptive. It is literally never too late to open up to those who love us and care about our development. Because the aspect of ourselves that goes outside of time in childhood gets stored in its chronological state, it is still that same age when it returns. God can use our current relationships to provide the nurturing we didn't receive as children, the mentoring we missed as school-age kids, or the companionship we needed as teenagers. God has promised that he will take care of us. Because time is experience, we can influence any \"past\" aspect of ourselves in the present, In the present we can reach the hurting , lonely child of our past.
