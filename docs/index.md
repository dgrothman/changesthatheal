# Changes That Heal

## Class Description
Changes That Heal is an 8-week class that goes through the 5 core symptoms based off 
***Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, & J. Keith Miller*. 
We work through each symptom and discuss tools and perspectives that help to create a 
framework for handling life as it comes, rather than being handled by life. It is more than anything
a safe place to try and experience our reality

## Class Breakdown

We help define what your reality is made up of and why it is so important as to how you interperet life, we also look at how we use negative control
to try and change another person's reality, or let them control our reality.

#### [Class 4 - Boundaries](/changesthatheal/C4-Boundaries/WhatAreBoundaries/)
Now that we have started to understand how do we protect that, and protect us from forcing that reality onto others?
Boundaries are how, they are the containers of our Reality. Not only do they protect us, but they also protect others
from us.

#### [Class 5 - Moderation](/changesthatheal/C5-Moderation/Moderation/)
As you grow you start to become aware of areas that are over-the-top or suppressed both of
which are not moderate, and then as you bring those areas into healing you will start to notice they get pulled back
to a more balanced moderate response.
Moderation is the balancing piece that ties very closely to your reality and boundaries, all three combined 
to give you a sense of your own empowerment and value.
