# Changes That Heal

## Class Description
Changes That Heal is an 8-week class that goes through the 5 core symptoms based off 
***Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, & J. Keith Miller*. 
We work through each symptom and discuss tools and perspectives that help to create a 
framework for handling life as it comes, rather than being handled by life. It is more than anything
a safe place to try and experience our reality

#### [Class 4 - Boundaries](/changesthatheal/C4-Boundaries/WhatAreBoundaries/)
Now that we have started to understand how do we protect that, and protect us from forcing that reality onto others?
Boundaries are how, they are the containers of our Reality. Not only do they protect us, but they also protect others
from us.
