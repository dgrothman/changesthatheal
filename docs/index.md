# Changes That Heal

## Class Description
Changes That Heal is an 8-week class that goes through the 5 core symptoms based off 
***Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, & J. Keith Miller*. 
We work through each symptom and discuss tools and perspectives that help to create a 
framework for handling life as it comes, rather than being handled by life. It is more than anything
a safe place to try and experience our reality
